<h1>Kabaret: 48 hours of MNKINO!</h1>
<p>We've locked in the date for our first MNKINO Kabaret! What's a Kabaret? It's a 48-hour filmmaking extravaganza, a weekend of MNKINO. It's all happening <strong>July 23rd–25th</strong> — we'll kick off with a Friday screening, after which we'll announce the Kabaret mystery meat. After that you'll have 48 hours to finish a film, screened the following Sunday.</p>
