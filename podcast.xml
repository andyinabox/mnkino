   <title>Never The Same River Twice (Bottineau Neighborhood)</title>

   <description>Never the same river twice looks at the flow of time and circumstance as the architect of change in Northeast Minneapolis. Starting at the banks of the Mississippi River we follow the river and the development of the Bottineau area since Pierre Bottineau himself first purchased this land. We will see the influences of the arrival of European immigrants, the migration of artists from the Warehouse district and the newest immigrant communities as they all resolve to make Northeast not only their home, but their neighborhood. Celebrate the hard work and innovation of neighbors past and present by walking in their footsteps and hearing their stories.</description>
