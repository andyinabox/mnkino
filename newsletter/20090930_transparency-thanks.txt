// MNKINO: Thanks! (September 30th, 2009)
=========================================
Hello! We're sending out this email to make a few announcements, and to thank all of you who've been a part of MNKINO these first few months. We've also made some updates to the MNKINO website, so feel free to check it out:

> # http://mnkino.com

And of course, the next screening: the theme will be "REPEAT" -- same bat time, same bat place...

> MNKINO #4: REPEAT
> Tuesday, October 20th, 8pm
> @ the West Bank Social Center


// Videos
----------
We've uploaded the videos from the first three screenings to our website! Find em' here:

> # ORANGE (July 21) -> http://mnkino.com/vids/orange/
> # ON / OFF (August 18) -> http://mnkino.com/vids/on-off/
> # TRANSPARENCY (September 22) -> http://mnkino.com/vids/transparency/



// Submissions
---------------
We're trying to streamline the submission process, and as part of that we're asking you to fill out a little form when you show a video at one of our screenings. We'd like to get contact info for everybody who participates, so we can keep you updated. You can find the submission form and more info about submissions here:

> # http://mnkino.com/submit/



// Really, thanks!
---------------------
We couldn't do it without you guys. While on the surface we stress the films, ultimately MNKINO is really about the community of producers, collaborators, and spectators who come. We're looking forward to more videos, more opportunities to collaborate, and trying out some of the other ideas we've been cooking up.


Definitely.

MNKINO co-directors
